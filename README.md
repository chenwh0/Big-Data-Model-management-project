## Phase 1

✅ Extract all hashtags & URLs in Tweets - Written in Python

✅ Run WordCount example in Apache Hadoop & Apache Spark on the extracted hashtags/URLs and collect the output and log files from Hadoop.
* ✅ Run WordCount example in Apache Hadoop - result in `hadoop_wordcount_result.txt`
* ✅ Run WordCount example in Apache Spark - result in `spark_wordcount_result.txt`

## Phase 2
🟩 Design and implement your creative ideas using Apache Spark, Ray, and Twitter data (or other good datasets)
* 🟩 Store and retrieve data in Spark
* 🟩 Develop interesting analytics use cases to explore and understand the data
* 🟩 Use Spark SQL queries as well as machine learning in Ray
* 🟩 Develop interesting visualizations (e.g., pie chart, heat map, bar graphs)
